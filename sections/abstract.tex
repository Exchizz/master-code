\chapter{Abstract}

The goal of this project is to redesign the architecture of an existing recording-system developed at SDU in order for the recording-system to be used in new use cases. The thesis starts by describing the use cases where the recording-system is currently used and the use cases where the system is intended to be used. An analysis follows from the use cases, where requirements for the design are extracted. From the design chapter, implementation requirements are extracted that lead to the implementation chapter which describes how a \pub{} and \sub{} are implemented, in order to verify the design. The implementation is then tested and verified with respect to the implementation requirements. In the discussion, the solution and the results are discussed which leads to the conclusion, that the architecture works.
